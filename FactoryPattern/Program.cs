    // Factory Pattern Exercise Repo
    
    // 1.
    // Create a console app that utilizes factory pattern
    // by taking a user’s input of how many tires are on a vehicle
    // and, based on their input, creates that type of vehicle.

    // 2.
    // Complete this using an interface.
    // You must have at least 2 subclasses.
    // For instance, if I type 4 into the console,
    // the program would create a car or truck,
    // or if someone types 2 it would create a motorcycle.

    /* Feel free to use something other than vehicles
     * if you want to be creative,
     * but the other constraints still apply! */
    
    // 3.
    // Create an Interface named IVehicle
    // that has a stubbed out public void Drive method.

    // 4. 
    // Create 2 new public classes
    // that will conform to IVehicle.
    // Example) Car, Motorcycle, BigRig
    //
    // Note: These classes must conform to IVehicle
    // and implement the Drive() method
    // - which will just Console.WriteLine(“Building a new Car!”)

    // 5.
    // Now we will make our static VehicleFactory class.

    // 6.
    // It will contain a static method GetVehicle(),
    // that will return an IVehicle based on the
    // amount of tires it’s given as a parameter

    // 7. 
    // Call this functionality in the Main method.
